## What is this
As it says above, Skynet Today is a site dedicated to providing accessible and informed written critique of the latest AI hype and panic. In other words, the idea is to offer a concise but comprehensive overview of each major AI story that bubbles up in popular media. Such stories attract the public attention more and more often in the past several years and receive a coverage that is sometimes inspired by emotionally resonant but unrealistic science fiction concepts such as Skynet, HAL 9000 or the Three Laws of Robotics. The hope is to get a variety of people with a knowledge of the field to cover the coverage of new events related to AI, and thus offer a more nuanced outlook which helpfully distinguishes the fiction from the factual. 

## Why are you doing this
We believe this needs to be done, that no one is really doing it, and that we have enough relevant knowledge to do it well. The conversation about AI is becoming increasingly relevant to many domains of society. To make sure it will be a productive one we need reliable and sensible sources of information and education about the topic. We believe such sources are necessary, yet currently few and far between, and that we have enough relevant knowledge to create one.

## Who are you
We are a group of researchers, engineers, and working professionals with domain knowledge in AI and investment in this site's mission. People actively contributing to the site include:
* [Andrey Kurenkov](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/): the site's creator, lead editor, and occasional contributor of news coverage and editorials. Andrey has BS Computer Science and Electrical Engineering degrees from Georgia Tech, and is currently a graduate student at Stanford where he studies and is doing research in AI. He likes writing [blog posts](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/) about miscellaneous topics and has [written](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning/) [several](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-game-ai/) long-form educational posts about AI. 
* [Josh Morton](https://joshuamorton.github.io/): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Josh has a BS CS degree from Georgia Tech, and is currently a software engineer at Google. While at GT he worked in the Robotics and Intelligent Machines Lab as well as The Agency (Geogia Tech's AI club). He likes to juggle.
* [Ben Shih](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benshih/): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Ben has BS CS and MS CS degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, and is currently completing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering focused on robotics at University of California, San Diego. He likes squishy robots.
* [Alex Constantino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexconstantino/): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Alex has a BS CS degree in Applied Math - Computer Science from Brown University, and is currently preparing to begin his studies at a medical school. Before this he had worked at Google for 2 and a half years, where he enabled qualitative analysts to analyze terrabyts of data, made critical contributions to a pilot project using large-scale machine learning to target Search promotions, and deployed a set of machine-learned classifiers to reduce the incidence of “fake news” in search results. He is into brewing beer. 
* [Limor Gultchin](https://institute.global/contributors/limor-gultchin): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Completed a computer science undergraduate degree at Harvard university, and is a future graduate student at the Oxford internet institute. A data scientist at the tony Blair global institute in London, using ml tools to study the rise of the populist tide and future facing policy solutions.
* [Aidan Rocke](http://paulispace.com/): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Discovering practical foundations for intelligent behaviour during the day; rebuilding trust in the information ecosystem at night. I am an applied mathematician trained at Edinburgh University that has previously contributed to OpenWorm, and consulted for companies focused on AI applied to locomotion and control tasks.
* [Apoorva Dornadula](https://web.stanford.edu/~apoorvad/): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science degree at Stanford University. Prior to this, I graduated from UC Berkeley where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My research interests include applied Computer Vision, NLP, and AI Safety.
* [Viraat Aryabumi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viraataryabumi/): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Completed an IT undergraduate degree at CBIT, Osmania University. Currently a Masters student in AI at the University of Edinburgh. Interested in reinforcement learning, bias in AI and AI safety.
* [Charlie Kilpatrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliekilpatrick/): a contributing author of news coverage and editorials. Software engineer at Microsoft. Squalid culture critic. Exhausted with tech journalism. Conscious of Artificial Intelligence, but primary skillset consists of telling others why they are wrong about Artificial Intelligence.
* [Anna Kurenkova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annakurenkova/): the lead of digital marketing for Skynet Today. She has a B.A. in Applied Linguistics from Georgia State University and is a recent graduate of Udacity's Digital Marketing Nanodegree program. She is a fan of learning to speak new languages, and can speak many.

## Yes, we are aware AI is an existential threat
Yes, we are quite aware of the [existential threat](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) possibilities of AI. The counterpoint to all that is wonderfully conveyed by [Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai/); an AGI or even scary doom AI is certainly possible, but we still seem far from it. In any case, this site's focus will be on providing perspective on stories in the here and now, not hypotheticals about the future.
