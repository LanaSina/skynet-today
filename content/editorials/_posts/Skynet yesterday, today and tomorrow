## Yesterday
Since launching only six weeks ago, we have more than tripled our dedicated staff (despite work on the site being done entirely for free and in free time) and more than doubled the number of the pieces on the website. Our recent writings include an evaluation of the response to the [Cambridge Analytica scandal] (https://www.skynettoday.com/content/news/camanalyt/), an explanation of the likely factors for the [recent Tesla crash](https://www.skynettoday.com/content/news/tesla-crash/), an overview of the [nuanced issue of biased AI models](https://www.skynettoday.com/content/news/face-recog/), and and investigation into [Alexa’s diabolic random laughter](https://www.skynettoday.com/content/news/alexa-laughter/) (spoiler alert: she wasn’t chuckling to herself while contemplating an AI takeover).

On another celebratory (if self-indulgent) note, we are immensely happy to have gained more readership after being upvoted on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16822376) and being endorsed by one of our personal heroes, Yann LeCun.

## Today
But, we did not write this piece just to pat ourselves on the back for all the progress we’ve made. Rather, our main motivation is to inform you of several exciting changes being made to the site as a result of that progress, and to make it a more helpful resource to AI experts and enthusiasts alike. 

First, we made some changes to our mission statement, that would also reflect our state of mind going forward. Instead of focusing on ‘hype’ or ‘panic’ we want to provide the most meaningful, insightful and clear coverage we can provide. Not in a contrarian, but rather in an engaging way. In other words we aim to Put AI News Into Perspective. 

We have laid out our core beliefs as well. The principles that guide us now are that:

* There exist many real and important dangers as well as prospects for present day AI, and it is important to distinguish between fact and fiction.

* Therefore, AI researchers and experts have a responsibility to promote understanding of their field within the general public with accessible writing.

* There are not sufficient efforts by AI researchers and experts to do this sort of writing, and that we have enough relevant knowledge to do it well.

And since we are geeks after all, we made some changes to the site to make it more organizationally and technically accessible as well:

* We support https now. Woo safety!

* We updated the toolbars and have clearer categories: Briefs, Digestion, Editorials.

* We are introducing pagination. We are growing and the page count does as well!

* We are adding a search functionality, to make it easier for you to search for content, now that we have more of it.

## Tomorrow

Our vision is to make sense in all that is big in the ever-buzzing public debate on AI, and beyond - to some of the research that comes out, to policy, to internal discussions in the AI community and so much more. That is a big task for a small team of volunteers with full time day jobs. 

Therefore we are introducing a new form of coverage - digests. This is a fancy way of saying we will start running a bi-weekly newsletter starting today, that will keep you up do date with what is talked about without having to take too much of your time (or ours :)). There’s so much to keep up with, and we know how difficult it can get to simply be on top of things. 

Please sign up here to keep up with our digests, as well as our longer, more in depth pieces.




And this is also a good time to once again reach out and ask: Are you an AI researcher? Grad student in a related field? Enthusiast? Want to help out? There’s plenty of work to do with getting us to a more informed and responsible debate about AI, and we could use all the help we can get. Please reach out to our email.

If you can’t commit the time to contribute with writing that’s fine! Share our content and help us spread the word, comment on our pieces, and help us create better AI conversations for all. 

## Thank You

And if you made it all the way down here we just wanted to thank you, the reader, for seeking out and reading this content. Many of you have reached out and expressed your appreciation, by which we are humbled and overjoyed.  We hope to keep on providing you with the informed and accessible coverage you deserve.
